// AuroraOS icon set — parametric vector glyphs drawn with GFX primitives.
//
// Every launcher row / control-centre tile / face chip pulls from this one
// table so the whole UI shares a single visual language. Icons are drawn
// centered on (cx, cy) inside a nominal box of `s` px (roughly the glyph
// height); strokes scale with s so the same icon works at 20 px and 60 px.
